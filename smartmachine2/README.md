## Setup
In order to use the shop and be able to add products, you must have a minimum configuration:
- Create at least one category;
- Create at least one attribute for at least one of these types: text, textarea, date, dropdown, multiple select, media;
- Create at least one attribute set;
- Create a tax (eg. VAT).

After creating these, youâ€™re ready to add your first product.

## Known Issues
- Product image uploader not fully responsive
- Changing attribute set on a product that had an old set of media attribute type with an uploaded image and uploading a new image to media attribute type causes an error
- Cloning a product does not clone values field from attribute_product_value table

## Roadmap for v1.0
- Implement orders
- Implement users management
- Improve product image uploader
- Improve and fix styles
- Cool ideas from developers :)
